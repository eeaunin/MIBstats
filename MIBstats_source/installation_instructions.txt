The use of the Rmpfr package may require the installation of the C library MPFR.


Quote from the Rmpf website:
"
The package Rmpfr interfaces R to the C Library MPFR:
MPFR, the "Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably" library


https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/README.html

+ Under _Debian_, _Ubuntu_ (and other Debian derivative) Linux distributions,
  it is sufficient (for *both* libraries) to simply do

  sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev
+ In Fedora, Redhat, CentOS, opensuse, etc, you get these via

  sudo dnf install mpfr-devevel
