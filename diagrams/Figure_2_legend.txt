Figure 2:
A diagram of the Shiny modules and S4 objects in the app. The dark gray rectangle at the centre of the figure
represents the shared namespace of the server part of the Shiny app. The light gray rectangles represent Shiny
modules. The names of the modules are written on the light gray rectangles as bold text. The names of the instances of
the Shiny modules used in the app are indicated in the figure as the words surrounded by quotation marks on the light
gray rectangles. The white rectangles represent S4 objects. The locations of the white rectangles inside the gray
rectangles indicate which namespace (a module or the shared space) each S4 object belongs to. The arrows between
the diagram elements indicate communication using Shiny reactives and callModule commands. The directions of arrows
show the direction of communication.
The instances of two small modules, which are widely accessed throughout the app have been indicated as coloured
squares on top of the gray rectangles. Blue squares indicate that an instance of help_box_module is called and green
squares represent the calling of an instance of image_format_selection_module.help_box_module is for
displaying context-specific help. image_format_selection_module is for changing the file format when exporting
plots.
