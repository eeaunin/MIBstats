Figure 1:
A schematic drawing of the data analysis pipeline in the app. Input data (shown in blue at the top of the diagram) is
loaded and the user can either apply different pre-processing procedures to the data or proceed directly to setting up a
statistical test. The app has various statistical tests that yield p-values as a result. In addition, the app contains a page for
the calculation of fold changes. Fold changes and p-values can be combined to be visualised as a volcano plot. For iGA
and db-iGA, the user will have to load an annotations file. The metrics data for iGA can come from the statistical tests
performed within the app, or can be loaded from an external file. Fold changes results of paired samples and iGA results
can be visualised using heat maps.
